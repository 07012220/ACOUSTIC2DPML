This is for the Marmousi2 model test and related figures.

***FILES DESCRIPTION
1) The file "para***.txt" is for setting model parameters. 
   The first parameter is the number of grid nodes in the x- direction.
   The second parameter is the number of grid nodes in the z- direction.
   The third parameter is the number of absorption layers in the x- direction.
   The fourth parameter is the number of absorption layers in the z- direction.
   The fifth parameter is the grid interval (i.e., the spatial sampling interval).
   The sixth parameter is for setting the type of the finite-difference schemes used, and 0 and 1 are for the 9-point and 17-point schemes, respectively. 
   The seventh parameter is for setting type of absorbing boundary conditions used, and 0, 1, and 2 are for the conventional PML, the CFS-PML and our optimized CFS-PML, respectively.
   The eighth parameter is the frequency interval.

2) "Marmousi2.mesh" is the mesh file for Marmousi2 model test.
