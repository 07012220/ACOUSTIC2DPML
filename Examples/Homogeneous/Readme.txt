This is for the homogeneous model test and related figures.

1 SUBFOLDER DESCRIPTION

*** /Inputs
This includes all the input files for running this test.

*** /Absolute error analysis
This is for comparing the absolute errors when using different finite-difference schemes with different boundary conditions.

*** /Seismograms
This is for plotting seismograms.

*** /Snapshots
This is for plotting snapshots.

*** /Parameter analysis
This is for comparing the results when using different values of the PML parameter \beta_0.


2 FIGURE PLOTTINGS
This section describes how to plot the figures presented in our GEOPHYSICS paper.

***Figures 6 and 7
You can obtain the Figures 6 and 7 in the paper by running "plot_seismograms.m" in the subfolder "/Examples/Homogeneous/seismograms".

***Figure 8
You can obtain the Figure 8 in the paper by running "err_analysis.m" in the subfolder "/Examples/Homogeneous/Absolute error analysis".

*** Figures 9 and 10
You can obtain the Figures 9 and 10 in the paper by running " snapshot.m" in the subfolder "/Examples/Homogeneous/Snapshots".

***Figures 11 and 12
You can obtain the Figures 11 and 12 in the paper by running "compare_beta0.m" in the subfolder "/Examples/Homogeneous/Parameter analysis".
