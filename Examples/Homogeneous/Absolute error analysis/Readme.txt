The file "err_analysis.m" is for comparing the absolute errors when using different PML boundary conditions for the homogeneous model test.

1. Input files
The input file "fsismos2" is the file for the analytical solution. 
The input file "9_PML.txt" is the result using the 9-point scheme with the conventional PML boundary condition.
The input file "9_CFSPML.txt" is the result using the 9-point scheme with the CFS-PML boundary condition.
The input file "9_optimizedCFSPML.txt" is the result using the 9-point scheme with our optimized CFS-PML boundary condition.
The input file "17_PML.txt" is the result using the 17-point scheme with the conventional PML boundary condition.
The input file "17_CFSPML.txt" is the result using the 17-point scheme with the CFS-PML boundary condition.
The input file "17_optimizedCFSPML.txt" is the result using the 17-point scheme with our optimized CFS-PML boundary.

2. Run the file "err_analysis.m" to get the Figure 8 in our GEOPHYSICS paper.
