The file "comparePML.m" is for plotting the results using different number of PML layers for the homogeneous model test. Note that our optimized CFS-PML boundary condition is used.

1. Input files
The input files "fsismos2" is the file for the analytical solution. 
The input files "17_optimizedCFSPML20.txt" is the result using 20 PML layers.
The input files "17_optimizedCFSPML40.txt" is the result using 40 PML layers.
The input files " 17_optimizedCFSPML120.txt" is the result using 120 PML layers. 

2. Run the file "comparePML.m" to get the figure for comparing results using different number of PML layers.
